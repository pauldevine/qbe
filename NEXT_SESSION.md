# Next session (§2z — CONTINUE CODEGEN QUALITY: bank the NEXT easy, localized, measurable i8086 size win. WHY: §2w + §2x + §2y proved the thesis — the young minic+qbe-i8086 backend emits a lot of unnecessary code, and removing it is the lever for a bigger image margin / bigger programs under the ~896KB Victor ceiling (the image is content-bound; see [[project-mp-heap-ceiling-analysis]]). §2w landed dead AX/DX save-bracket elimination (-51520 B); §2x landed Kl-param-copy elimination (-57712 B); §2y landed redundant-arg-marshal elimination (-1952 B). Same discipline: pick ONE win, land it green + measured + Victor-verified, then stop. Do NOT attempt a register-allocator rewrite or a general peephole framework.

> **§2z PLAN (next) — pick ONE remaining easy win, same loop as
> §2w/§2x/§2y (make check green AND DOS gate 184/184 AND a real image-size
> drop AND unchanged Victor output). Candidates, in rough order of
> expected payoff (MEASURE before committing — §2y's headline pattern was
> real but only -1952 B total, far smaller than the AX/DX/param wins, so
> don't assume a visible idiom is a big aggregate win):**
>
>  1. **div/rem AX/DX save-bracket liveness gating** (i8086/emit.c
>     Odiv/Oudiv/Orem/Ourem, ~line 2463).  This site still gates its
>     `push ax/cx/dx` brackets ONLY on `dst_in_*`, NOT on the §2w
>     `g_live_ax_after`/`g_live_dx_after` liveness flags.  Mirror §2w:
>     `save_ax &= g_live_ax_after; save_dx &= g_live_dx_after`.  (CX has
>     no liveness tracker — §2w only tracks AX/DX — so leave `save_cx`
>     as-is unless you extend compute_axdx_liveafter to CX, which is a
>     bigger change.)  CLEARLY SOUND (same strict over-approximation as
>     §2w).  362 div/rem call sites in the image, so bounded but real.
>     The Oextsw/Oextuw site just below (~line 2522) already uses
>     kl_save_axdx (liveness-gated) — good reference.
>
>  2. **Kw-param copy** (same shape as §2x but for Kw params).  Kw params
>     currently get a register, so aliasing to a slot may be a WASH or
>     worse — MEASURE before committing.
>
> NON-GOALS (unchanged): register-allocator rewrite, general peephole
> framework, near-call conversion, inlining, FAR_DATA/segment-model changes.
>
> MEASUREMENT LOOP (per win): `make qbe`; `make check` green; `bash
> tools/test-dos.sh` green (**184/184**; the Kl-clobber + structarg/param
> probes are the safety net); recompile one TU with
> `tools/recompile-mp-tu.sh <base> <src>` and eyeball the asm (NOTE:
> recompile-mp-tu.sh needs /tmp/mp_objs.txt for the relink step — gone on
> reboot; a full build regenerates the objs but NOT that file, so the
> relink is skipped; the per-TU asm is still produced and that's what you
> eyeball); then full `tools/build-micropython.sh --model=compact
> --keep-going` for the body bytes (**§2y left it at body 742096 with heap
> 49152**; §2x was 744048, §2w 772064, all at the same heap); then run on
> the real Victor:
>   `VICTOR_SRC=build/mp-test.py tools/run-victor-sasi.sh build/mp-link/mpython.exe 90`
> must still print `[2..37] / 12 / 197 / fib→514229 / 5 / 21`, clean
> `D4 C5`.  **Victor harness gotchas (re-confirmed §2y):** (a) the run is
> deterministic; EMPTY serial output = a host invocation problem, not MAME
> flakiness.  (b) Do NOT pipe the run through `tail` — it buffers ALL
> output until the pipe closes, so you see nothing mid-run and a 0-byte
> result if the wrapper is killed early.  Redirect straight to a file
> (`… > /tmp/victor_out.txt 2>&1`) and `run_in_background: true`; MAME
> under -nothrottle for 90 emulated sec takes SEVERAL real minutes, longer
> than a 300s monitor window, so wait for the task completion notification
> (not the monitor) and read the file.  Commit qbe-repo files at the green
> milestone; the MicroPython port tree is untracked (note port-tree
> changes in this file).

>  - **The win**: selcall writes each call's args into the shared arg-slot
>    region at the bottom of the frame.  When two calls in the same block
>    pass the IDENTICAL value at the IDENTICAL slot+width with no other
>    store touching those words between them, the second marshal is dead —
>    the slot already holds the value.  `_mp_hal_stdout_tx_str` (str passed
>    to both `far_strlen` and `tx_strn_cooked`) dropped its second
>    `mov ax,[bp+6];mov dx,[bp+8];mov [bp-12],ax;mov [bp-10],dx` block.
>  - **Implementation**: new `dedup_arg_stores(fn)` in i8086/abi.c, called
>    at the end of i8086_abi (abi1, post-SSA so an RTmp source is
>    single-assignment / stable).  Per-block forward scan; per arg-slot
>    WORD it tracks the last (store-op, src-ref); a candidate arg store
>    (isstore + RSlot dest with `0 <= rsval < fn->arg_slot_top`) is dropped
>    iff every word it covers already holds the identical (op, src).  Any
>    store overwrites the tracked words (defeating a later spurious match);
>    tracking resets per block.
>  - **SOUNDNESS** rests on ONE closed-world invariant: an intervening
>    call does NOT write the arg slots passed to it.  Verified true here —
>    minic copies each incoming param into a fresh local alloca and never
>    writes the incoming `[bp+N]` slot (the `%str=alloc4 + storel %t0`
>    shape), and every hand-written libstub / libstub_to_exe helper reads
>    its stack args into registers (grep confirmed: no `mov [bp+N],…` in
>    either).  So a call clobbers caller-save REGISTERS but never
>    caller-frame arg-slot MEMORY; we deliberately do NOT invalidate
>    tracking on a call.  A warning documenting this invariant was added to
>    the top of minic/dos/libstub.asm (a future helper that writes an
>    incoming arg slot in place would silently break the next call).
>  - **Results**: compact image body **744048 → 742096 B (-1952)**; heap
>    stays 49152 (segment-bound, not load-bound — freed bytes become image
>    margin under the ~896KB Victor ceiling).  `make check` green; DOS gate
>    **184/184**; real-Victor mp-test.py output unchanged
>    (`[2..37]/12/197/fib→514229/5/21`, clean `D4 C5`).
>  - **Honest note**: the win is an order of magnitude smaller than §2w/§2x
>    — the redundant-marshal idiom is locally visible but rare in aggregate.
>    Still green/sound/measured, so banked.

> **§2x (DONE 2026-06-03) — i8086 Kl-parameter materialization-copy
> elimination.  ONE codegen win, fully verified.  COMMITTED (i8086/abi.c,
> i8086/emit.c, spill.c).**
>
>  - **The win**: every function with a Kl (far-pointer / `long`) parameter
>    copied it from its incoming ABI stack slot (`[bp+6]`) into a fresh
>    below-BP forced-Kl slot (`[bp-14]`) at entry — `mov ax,[bp+6];mov
>    dx,[bp+8];mov [bp-14],ax;mov [bp-12],dx` — then read it from there.
>    The copy is dead: a param SSA temp is never reassigned (minic mutates
>    params through a separate alloca), so `[bp+6]` always holds the passed
>    value.  Now the param temp is ALIASED to its incoming ABI slot, so the
>    materialization load becomes a no-op self-copy that emit elides; every
>    use reads `[bp+6]` directly.
>  - **Implementation** (3 files): (1) `spill.c` — a pre-pass inside the
>    existing `force_kl_slot` block scans `fn->start` for the selpar pattern
>    `%t =l load SLOT(s)` with `s < 0` (a negative slot only ever names a
>    read-only incoming param) and pre-sets `tmp[%t].slot = s`, so the
>    following `slot()` loop reuses it instead of carving a fresh below-BP
>    slot.  (2) `i8086/emit.c` — the Oload Kl handler elides an
>    `Oload Kl SLOT(s) <- SLOT(s)` when `s < 0` (reading and writing the
>    same param memory is a no-op; the `s < 0` gate keeps it away from the
>    spilled-Kl-ptr deref case at slot idx >= arg_slot_top).  (3)
>    `i8086/abi.c` — comment only.  **KEY GOTCHA (cost a debug cycle):** the
>    alias MUST be set in spill.c (after isel), NOT in abi.c (before isel).
>    i8086 isel's `fixarg` (i8086/isel.c:57) overloads a non-(-1)
>    `tmp[].slot` to mean "this temp is a fast-local alloca whose value is
>    its slot ADDRESS" and would materialize `addr S-3` (i.e. `&param`,
>    `lea [bp+6];ss`) instead of the param value.  Setting the slot only
>    after isel avoids that collision.
>  - **Results**: `_f`-shaped probe `sub sp,14`→`sub sp,6` and the 4-instr
>    copy gone; compact image body **801760 → 744048 B (-57712)**.  `make
>    check` green; DOS gate **184/184** (structarg/param/Kl-clobber probes
>    green = no ABI/aliasing regression); real-Victor mp-test.py output
>    unchanged (`[2..37]/12/197/fib→514229/5/21`, clean `D4 C5`).
>  - **No heap bonus this time**: heap stays 49152 — it is already at the
>    compact-model ~64 KB single-segment ceiling (NOT the DOS load
>    ceiling), so freed code bytes become image margin under the ~896KB
>    Victor limit, not more heap.  See `ports/dos8086/mpconfigport.h:89`.
