## What changed §1n (so you don't redo it)

**One real grammar gap fixed — extern array with a constant-EXPRESSION
dimension.**  `extern char buf[(32) + 1];` parse-errored while
`extern char buf[2];` parsed.  The `EXTERN type IDENT '[' NUM ']' ';'` rule was
the lone array-decl holdout still pinned to `NUM`; changed it to
`'[' expr ']'` (line ~5313 in `minic/minic.y`).  An extern allocates no storage
here, so the folded size is discarded.  0 new conflicts (still 111 s/r 0 r/r).
Flipped extmod/network_ppp_lwip.c (its `mod_network_hostname_data[(…)+1]`).
Probe `extern_array_expr_probe.c` (medium + large).

**Pre-existing gap found, NOT fixed (didn't block any real consumer):**
file-scope sized char array initialised from a string literal —
`char g[5] = "abcd";` parse-errors even with a plain literal dim (brace init
`char g[5] = {'a',…};` and unsized `char g[] = "abcd";` both work).  The probe
sidesteps it with brace init.  Fix later only if a consumer needs it.

## What changed §1m (so you don't redo it)

Four grammar/codegen wins, all in `minic/minic.y` (+ gate wiring), no i8086/QBE
backend changes, **no new conflicts (still 111 s/r, 0 r/r)**, `make check` green.
**Flipped binary, objlist, modbuiltins, objtype, parse** (126→131).

1. **Anonymous struct/union as a type** (flips binary, objlist; half of
   modbuiltins) — `struct { … }` / `union { … }` can now be used directly as a
   `type` (in a cast `(struct{…}*)0`, a local decl `struct{…} v;`, a typedef
   `typedef struct{…} T;`, or a struct member `struct{…} name;`).  The §1k
   attempt (`type: typedefstructstart smembers '}'`) gave **76 r/r** because
   `STRUCT '{'` then had TWO empty marker reductions reachable inside a struct
   body: `typedefstructstart` (anon typedef) and `nested_s_begin` (nested anon
   member).  **Fix = UNIFY them.**  There is now exactly ONE marker for
   `STRUCT '{'` / `UNION '{'` — `nested_s_begin` / `nested_u_begin` (always
   pushes the enclosing `curstruct`, or -1 at top level, onto `structstk`).
   `type: nested_s_begin smembers '}'` pops it and returns `(idx<<3)+STRUCT_T`.
   The former dedicated *named*-nested member rules (`nested_s_begin smembers
   '}' IDENT ';'`) were **removed** — `struct{…} name;` now flows through the
   existing `smembers type IDENT ';'` (its `type` reduces the anon aggregate,
   popping structstk back to the parent first).  `typedef struct{…} T;` flows
   through `TYPEDEF type IDENT ';'`.  `typedefstructstart`/`typedefunionstart`
   are now **tagged-only** (`STRUCT IDENT '{'`) and still back the tagged
   `typedef struct Tag{…} T;` path.  Anon-hoist (`struct{…};` no name) keeps its
   `nestedagg: nested_s_begin smembers '}' ';'` rule.  Probe `anon_aggr_probe.c`.
2. **Function-local + inner-block anonymous enum** (other half of modbuiltins)
   — `enum { A, B, C };` as a statement.  Added `dcls: dcls enumstart enums '}'
   ';'` (function-body top) AND `stmt: enumstart enums '}' ';'` (inner block),
   both mirroring file-scope `edcl` (constants registered by the `enums` rule;
   no storage).  Covered by `anon_aggr_probe.c` cases b/c.
3. **Compound literal with NESTED brace, incl. through a deref** (flips
   objtype) — `*o = (T){{a}, b, c};` (py/objtype.c's `mp_obj_super_t`, whose
   first member is a sub-struct filled by `{…}`).  `inititem` now accepts
   `'{' initlist '}'` and `.field = '{' initlist '}'`.  The expr() and lval()
   compound-literal paths previously had DUPLICATE inline member-fill loops;
   both now call one shared recursive `emit_clit_aggr(clitnum, base_off, sidx,
   init)` that descends into a sub-struct/union member on a nested-brace item.
   The lval() path matters because a struct compound literal on the RHS of
   `*p = …` is re-materialised via lval() to get its address for the struct
   copy.  Probe `nested_clit_probe.c`.
4. **Cast to a function-pointer type** (flips parse) — `(RET (*)(PARAMS)) expr`
   (py/parse.c: `ctx.func = (void (*)(void *))(mp_lexer_free);`).  New
   `pref: '(' type '(' '*' ')' '(' fptpar0 ')' ')' pref` reusing the existing
   `fptpar0` param-type list; the cast type is `IDIR(FUNC($2))`, reinterpreting
   the operand.  Distinguished from the plain cast / compound literal by the
   token after `type` (`(` vs `)`).  Probe `fnptr_cast_probe.c`.

Three probes added (each medium + large): `anon_aggr_probe.c`,
`nested_clit_probe.c`, `fnptr_cast_probe.c`.  Gate **115→121**.

## What changed §1l (so you don't redo it)

**for-init inner-block scope** — closed compile.c's sibling for-loop double
definition. The three C99 for-init rules share a `forinit_var: type IDENT '='`
nonterminal; the state after `type IDENT =` is a single-action state miniyacc
**default-reduces without lexing lookahead**, so the rename binding is
established before the test/increment/body uses are lexed.  Probe
`for_init_scope_probe.c`.  The apostrophe-in-action-comment footgun was also
fixed (commit `a4a1fe7`): `cpycode` in `minic/yacc.c` is comment-aware, so
action comments can use `'`/`"`/braces freely.

## Scope for next session — the py/*.c spike is done; what's next?

The 12-file py/*.c grammar spike is effectively complete (131/132; the one
remaining is the `stream` harness include gap above, not a minic bug).  Pick
the next real consumer:

1. **Move past the spike to an actual MicroPython BUILD.**  The spike only
   confirms each TU *parses + emits SSA* under `clang -E`.  The real port needs
   (a) the MicroPython build system pointed at minic + the i8086 backend, (b)
   the QSTR/genhdr codegen-generated headers, (c) a libc/runtime surface much
   larger than the DOS stubs.  See `MICROPYTHON_PORT.md` for the staging plan.
   Expect new *semantic* (not grammar) gaps once linking real TUs together.

2. **Widen the spike beyond py/*.c** if you want more grammar coverage first —
   `extmod/*.c`, `shared/*.c`, a port's `*.c`.  Same harness; new constructs
   will surface.  Cheaper than a full build; good for de-risking grammar before
   the build bring-up.

3. **`stream` harness fix (optional)** — if you want a literal 132/132, add the
   missing `<stdio.h>` SEEK_* defines to the spike stub-include dir
   (`build/mp-spike/stubinc`).  Cosmetic; doesn't exercise minic.

## How to find the true site (lag-proof technique, unchanged)
minic's reported error line is the parser's *lookahead* line and lags the real
construct.  Read the real message by running minic directly on
`build/mp-spike/pp/<file>.pp.c` (not the lagged summary.tsv line).
Forward-bisect on column-0 `}` boundaries with brace auto-balancing (a small
python `head -n CUT` + append `}`×(open-count) reproduces far enough into a
function body); the FIRST cut whose prefix errors brackets the construct.  This
session that pinned the fnptr-cast at line 2718 of parse.pp.c in seconds.

## Guardrails (unchanged)
- Rebuild with `cd minic && make minic`; local `yacc` prints conflict counts
  (now **111 s/r, 0 r/r**). Justify any new shift/reduce; **no new
  reduce/reduce**. miniyacc is picky: no `/* … */` between a production head and
  its `:` (this bit twice this session — keep standalone comments OUT of the
  space between a `;` and the next rule head; put them inside the action body
  instead, where `cpycode` is now comment-aware).
- Run `tools/test-dos.sh` (must stay **121/121**) and `make check` (SSA, "All
  is fine!") at the **repo root** (not minic/). Add or extend a probe per
  runtime-bearing feature; the gate runs ~5 min in DOSBox — run it in the
  background and wait.
- Spike harness uses **`clang -E`** (the build-example.sh path uses `cpp`).
- DOSBox capture is occasionally flaky. If a `--model=large` probe diff fails
  once, re-run.

## Orthogonal pre-existing limits (don't chase unless a real consumer needs them)
- **Two divisions feeding one call** — i8086 div AX/DX clobber, `[[i8086-two-div-one-call-clobber]]`.
- **Far-data static pointer relocation** (`l $sym` → far seg:off) — `&global`
  data items are near-only, so probes that take a static address are medium-only.
- **Bare file-scope scalar pointer initializer** — `static int *p = &g;` parse-errors.
- **File-scope sized char array from a string literal** — `char g[5] = "abcd";`
  parse-errors (brace init `{'a',…}` and unsized `char g[] = "abcd";` work).
  Found §1n; not fixed (no consumer blocked).
- **Inline `100000L` literal** — lexer drops the `L`; build from small-literal arithmetic.
- **Deep block-scope shadow of an already-renamed name** — §1k's alpha-renaming
  handles sibling blocks, single-level shadow, and inner-then-function-scope
  collisions; a *declarator* lexed while an outer rename of the same name is
  active (double shadow) can mis-stamp.  See `[[minic-inner-block-scope]]`.
- **Compound literal is evaluated twice on `*p = (T){…}`** — the struct-copy
  assignment path runs expr() (materialise + load) then lval() (materialise +
  address) on the same 'L' node, emitting the literal into two `_clit` slots.
  Correct, just wasteful; not worth fixing unless it shows up hot.
