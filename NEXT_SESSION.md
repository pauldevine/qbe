>    `__builtin_clz` is mangled by minic to `___builtin_clz` and called via
>    `call far ___builtin_clz`.  `collect_referenced_syms`'s regex
>    `\b(_[A-Za-z]…)` can't match it — the word boundary sits before the FIRST
>    underscore, which is followed by `_` not a letter, so the symbol was never
>    added to the `extern` set and nasm failed "symbol not defined".  Fix:
>    `\b(_+[A-Za-z][\w]*)`.  (NB: `___builtin_clz` itself still has no runtime
>    impl — that's a libstub/link-layer gap for later; the per-TU object just
>    needs the extern declared.)
> 2. **C labels collided across functions** (py/runtime.c).  Two functions each
>    with a `too_short:` C label both emitted the flat `@user_too_short` block
>    → one asm symbol `user_too_short:` defined twice → nasm "inconsistently

>    per-function counter `cur_fn_labelid` (bumped at all 4 function-body emit
>    starts) suffixes every user label `@user_<name>_F<id>` at the Goto/Label
>    emit sites.  These labels aren't exported, so cross-module is already safe;
>    only the intra-module collision needed fixing.  Pinned by `dup_label_probe.c`.
> 3. **16-bit Ocopy of a relocatable address into a slot dropped the size**
>    (py/mpprint.c `_pad_common+17`, py/objstr.c `__str_uni_strip_whitespace`).
>    `=w add $sym, off` folds to a copy; when rega lands it in a slot the
>    generic `{Ocopy,Ki,"mov %=, %0"}` template emitted `mov [bp-N], _sym+off`
>    with no `word`, so nasm's OBJ writer rejected the relocation ("OBJ format
>    can only handle 16- or 32-bit relocations").  Fix in `i8086/emit.c`: an
>    early special-case for `Ocopy Kw && to=RSlot && arg[0]=RCon` emits
>    `mov word [bp-N], <imm/addr>` (no scratch reg, rega unaffected).  The Kl
>    Ocopy path already sized CAddr→slot correctly.  Pinned by `caddr_slot_probe.c`

# Next session — MicroPython port: py/*.c CODEGEN-clean (132/132 to i8086 asm) (post §1o)

>    sites: general binop ~3155, inc/dec ~3070, float→int cast ~2745).
>    `uint16_t+uint16_t` / `uint8_t+uint8_t` where both operands share the
>    narrow type made `prom()` return that type, so the add result temp was
>    `=h`/`=b` — invalid QBE temp class (only w/l/s/d).  `irtyp_ret()` widens
>    char/short→`w` (also C-correct: integer promotion).  Flipped
>    emitbc/gc/objringio/ringbuf ("invalid class specifier").
> 2. **Seq fall-through termination with a trailing goto-label** — `stmt(Seq)`

>    qbe "block @user_X is used undefined".  Now goto labels are kept too (the
>    same `contains_label` check).  Flipped runtime (`power_overflow:` in
>    `mp_binary_op`).
>

## What changed §1n (so you don't redo it)

**One real grammar gap fixed — extern array with a constant-EXPRESSION
dimension.**  `extern char buf[(32) + 1];` parse-errored while
`extern char buf[2];` parsed.  The `EXTERN type IDENT '[' NUM ']' ';'` rule was
the lone array-decl holdout still pinned to `NUM`; changed it to
`'[' expr ']'` (line ~5313 in `minic/minic.y`).  An extern allocates no storage
here, so the folded size is discarded.  0 new conflicts (still 111 s/r 0 r/r).
Flipped extmod/network_ppp_lwip.c (its `mod_network_hostname_data[(…)+1]`).
Probe `extern_array_expr_probe.c` (medium + large).

**Pre-existing gap found, NOT fixed (didn't block any real consumer):**
file-scope sized char array initialised from a string literal —
`char g[5] = "abcd";` parse-errors even with a plain literal dim (brace init
`char g[5] = {'a',…};` and unsized `char g[] = "abcd";` both work).  The probe
sidesteps it with brace init.  Fix later only if a consumer needs it.

## What changed §1m (so you don't redo it)

Four grammar/codegen wins, all in `minic/minic.y` (+ gate wiring), no i8086/QBE
backend changes, **no new conflicts (still 111 s/r, 0 r/r)**, `make check` green.
**Flipped binary, objlist, modbuiltins, objtype, parse** (126→131).

1. **Anonymous struct/union as a type** (flips binary, objlist; half of
   modbuiltins) — `struct { … }` / `union { … }` can now be used directly as a
   `type` (in a cast `(struct{…}*)0`, a local decl `struct{…} v;`, a typedef
   `typedef struct{…} T;`, or a struct member `struct{…} name;`).  The §1k
   attempt (`type: typedefstructstart smembers '}'`) gave **76 r/r** because
   `STRUCT '{'` then had TWO empty marker reductions reachable inside a struct
   body: `typedefstructstart` (anon typedef) and `nested_s_begin` (nested anon
   member).  **Fix = UNIFY them.**  There is now exactly ONE marker for
   `STRUCT '{'` / `UNION '{'` — `nested_s_begin` / `nested_u_begin` (always
   pushes the enclosing `curstruct`, or -1 at top level, onto `structstk`).
   `type: nested_s_begin smembers '}'` pops it and returns `(idx<<3)+STRUCT_T`.
   The former dedicated *named*-nested member rules (`nested_s_begin smembers
   '}' IDENT ';'`) were **removed** — `struct{…} name;` now flows through the
   existing `smembers type IDENT ';'` (its `type` reduces the anon aggregate,
   popping structstk back to the parent first).  `typedef struct{…} T;` flows
   through `TYPEDEF type IDENT ';'`.  `typedefstructstart`/`typedefunionstart`
   are now **tagged-only** (`STRUCT IDENT '{'`) and still back the tagged
   `typedef struct Tag{…} T;` path.  Anon-hoist (`struct{…};` no name) keeps its
   `nestedagg: nested_s_begin smembers '}' ';'` rule.  Probe `anon_aggr_probe.c`.
2. **Function-local + inner-block anonymous enum** (other half of modbuiltins)
   — `enum { A, B, C };` as a statement.  Added `dcls: dcls enumstart enums '}'
   ';'` (function-body top) AND `stmt: enumstart enums '}' ';'` (inner block),
   both mirroring file-scope `edcl` (constants registered by the `enums` rule;
   no storage).  Covered by `anon_aggr_probe.c` cases b/c.
3. **Compound literal with NESTED brace, incl. through a deref** (flips
   objtype) — `*o = (T){{a}, b, c};` (py/objtype.c's `mp_obj_super_t`, whose
   first member is a sub-struct filled by `{…}`).  `inititem` now accepts
   `'{' initlist '}'` and `.field = '{' initlist '}'`.  The expr() and lval()
   compound-literal paths previously had DUPLICATE inline member-fill loops;
   both now call one shared recursive `emit_clit_aggr(clitnum, base_off, sidx,
   init)` that descends into a sub-struct/union member on a nested-brace item.
   The lval() path matters because a struct compound literal on the RHS of
   `*p = …` is re-materialised via lval() to get its address for the struct
   copy.  Probe `nested_clit_probe.c`.
4. **Cast to a function-pointer type** (flips parse) — `(RET (*)(PARAMS)) expr`
   (py/parse.c: `ctx.func = (void (*)(void *))(mp_lexer_free);`).  New
   `pref: '(' type '(' '*' ')' '(' fptpar0 ')' ')' pref` reusing the existing
   `fptpar0` param-type list; the cast type is `IDIR(FUNC($2))`, reinterpreting
   the operand.  Distinguished from the plain cast / compound literal by the
   token after `type` (`(` vs `)`).  Probe `fnptr_cast_probe.c`.

Three probes added (each medium + large): `anon_aggr_probe.c`,
`nested_clit_probe.c`, `fnptr_cast_probe.c`.  Gate **115→121**.

## What changed §1l (so you don't redo it)

**for-init inner-block scope** — closed compile.c's sibling for-loop double
definition. The three C99 for-init rules share a `forinit_var: type IDENT '='`
nonterminal; the state after `type IDENT =` is a single-action state miniyacc
**default-reduces without lexing lookahead**, so the rename binding is
established before the test/increment/body uses are lexed.  Probe
`for_init_scope_probe.c`.  The apostrophe-in-action-comment footgun was also
fixed (commit `a4a1fe7`): `cpycode` in `minic/yacc.c` is comment-aware, so
action comments can use `'`/`"`/braces freely.

## Scope for next session — build bring-up, the next layer down the pipeline

All 132 py/*.c now go C→preprocess→minic(SSA)→qbe(i8086 asm)→asm_to_omf+nasm
cleanly (§1o codegen, §1p asm→obj).  The next layers toward a runnable REPL,
in increasing cost:

1. **DONE (§1p): asm→obj per TU.**  `build/mp-spike/run-asmobj.sh` wraps each
   `cg/<base>.asm` with `asm_to_omf.py` + `nasm -f obj`; 132/132 produce OMF
   objects.  Three gaps fixed (multi-`_` externs, per-function label
   uniquification, 16-bit Ocopy-CAddr→slot size) — see §1p above.

2. **First real LINK of a curated core subset** (NOW the cheapest next signal).
   The dos8086 port does NOT
   need all 131 host objects — drop the other-arch `asm*`/`emitn*`/`nlr*`
   (keep `nlrsetjmp`).  Needs: (a) genhdr headers (already generated at
   `~/projects/micropython/ports/minimal/build/genhdr/` — point `-I` at it or
   regenerate for dos8086), (b) `ports/dos8086/main.c` + `mphalport.c`, (c) a
   `tools/build-micropython.sh` that compiles the subset + crt0 + libstub and
   `omf_link`s them.  Expect: multi-segment far-code link limits (~50+ code
   segments), and `setjmp`/`longjmp` (NLR) — `jmp_buf` is an array typedef;
   real medium-model setjmp/longjmp is still a Phase-2 libc gap.  Milestone:
   `print(1+2)` → `3` in DOSBox (Phase 4).

3. **Widen the codegen spike to extmod/shared** (optional de-risk) — the parse
   spike already cleared them (90/96, rest harness/arch); running them through
   qbe would surface any remaining backend gaps cheaply.

Master staging plan + phase table: `MICROPYTHON_PORT.md`.

## How to find the true site (lag-proof technique, unchanged)
minic's reported error line is the parser's *lookahead* line and lags the real
construct.  Read the real message by running minic directly on
`build/mp-spike/pp/<file>.pp.c` (not the lagged summary.tsv line).
Forward-bisect on column-0 `}` boundaries with brace auto-balancing (a small
python `head -n CUT` + append `}`×(open-count) reproduces far enough into a
function body); the FIRST cut whose prefix errors brackets the construct.  This
session that pinned the fnptr-cast at line 2718 of parse.pp.c in seconds.

## Guardrails (unchanged)
- Rebuild with `cd minic && make minic`; local `yacc` prints conflict counts
  (now **111 s/r, 0 r/r**). Justify any new shift/reduce; **no new
  reduce/reduce**. miniyacc is picky: no `/* … */` between a production head and
  its `:` (this bit twice this session — keep standalone comments OUT of the
  space between a `;` and the next rule head; put them inside the action body
  instead, where `cpycode` is now comment-aware).
- Run `tools/test-dos.sh` (must stay **128/128**) and `make check` (SSA, "All
  is fine!") at the **repo root** (not minic/). Add or extend a probe per
  runtime-bearing feature; the gate runs ~5 min in DOSBox — run it in the
  background and wait.
- Spike harness uses **`clang -E`** (the build-example.sh path uses `cpp`).
- DOSBox capture is occasionally flaky. If a `--model=large` probe diff fails
  once, re-run.

## Orthogonal pre-existing limits (don't chase unless a real consumer needs them)
- **Two divisions feeding one call** — i8086 div AX/DX clobber, `[[i8086-two-div-one-call-clobber]]`.
- **Far-data static pointer relocation** (`l $sym` → far seg:off) — `&global`
  data items are near-only, so probes that take a static address are medium-only.
- **Bare file-scope scalar pointer initializer** — `static int *p = &g;` parse-errors.
- **File-scope sized char array from a string literal** — `char g[5] = "abcd";`
  parse-errors (brace init `{'a',…}` and unsized `char g[] = "abcd";` work).
  Found §1n; not fixed (no consumer blocked).
- **Inline `100000L` literal** — lexer drops the `L`; build from small-literal arithmetic.
- **Deep block-scope shadow of an already-renamed name** — §1k's alpha-renaming
  handles sibling blocks, single-level shadow, and inner-then-function-scope
  collisions; a *declarator* lexed while an outer rename of the same name is
  active (double shadow) can mis-stamp.  See `[[minic-inner-block-scope]]`.
- **Compound literal is evaluated twice on `*p = (T){…}`** — the struct-copy
  assignment path runs expr() (materialise + load) then lval() (materialise +
  address) on the same 'L' node, emitting the literal into two `_clit` slots.
  Correct, just wasteful; not worth fixing unless it shows up hot.
